a. Access Twitter by downloading and installing the appropriate library for your programming language. For example, if you program in Java, install a stable version of Twitter4J (documentation is at http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html).

Information about Twitterâ€™s APIs is here: https://dev.twitter.com and https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation
Libraries are here: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/twitter-libraries
Code examples (for Twitter4J) are here: http://twitter4j.org/en/code-examples.html

b. Develop a program that gets recent tweets (either through the Streaming API or the REST API) and outputs them to a file. Upload only your program (your source code) to NYU Classes. Do not upload any input or output data (no tweets).

Note: This is not a Hadoop assignment, but it has proven helpful in the past because by completing this assignment, you will have at least one data source that you can use for your analytic.
